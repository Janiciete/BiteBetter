# BetterBites

A personalized recipe transformation app. Paste any recipe, and BetterBites rewrites it around your allergies, dietary preferences, health goals, budget, and safety needs.

---

## What It Does

Users create a nutrition profile once. Then, in the Chef tab, they paste or type any recipe. The app transforms it into a personalized version and shows a simplified result — ingredient swaps, before/after nutrition, scores, cost summary, and safety warnings. Transformed recipes can be saved, rated, and aggregated into a grocery list.

> BetterBites is not medical advice or a medical diagnostic tool. For high-risk concerns (pregnancy, medications, severe allergies, medical conditions), consult a doctor or healthcare professional.

## Core User Flow

1. Create a nutrition profile
2. Open the Chef tab and paste a recipe
3. App transforms the recipe based on your profile
4. View simplified results first (scores, ingredients, cost, warnings)
5. Expand for full detail or visit the Why This? tab
6. Save the recipe
7. Saved recipes appear in the Recipes tab (with star ratings)
8. Ingredients from saved recipes roll up into the Grocery List tab

## Supabase Tables

| Table | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `profiles` | One row per user, stores all profile fields. RLS: user sees only their own row. |
| `recipes` | Saved transformed recipes (includes original text + full transformation as JSONB). RLS: user sees only their own rows. |

Grocery list is derived client-side from saved recipe ingredients — no separate table needed.

---

## API Routes

| Method | Route | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/profile` | Fetch current user's profile |
| POST | `/api/profile` | Create or upsert profile |
| POST | `/api/transform-recipe` | Transform a pasted recipe |
| GET | `/api/recipes` | List saved recipes |
| POST | `/api/recipes` | Save a transformed recipe |
| PATCH | `/api/recipes/[id]` | Update star rating |
| DELETE | `/api/recipes/[id]` | Delete a saved recipe |
| GET | `/api/grocery-list` | Aggregated ingredients from all saved recipes |

---

## Build Phases

| Phase | Scope | Est. Time |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Project bootstrap (Next.js, Tailwind, Supabase setup) | ~1 hour |
| 2 | Auth + profile onboarding wizard | ~2 hours |
| 3 | Recipe transformer core (rule-based) + Chef tab UI | ~3 hours |
| 4 | Save recipes + Recipes tab + star ratings | ~1 hour |
| 5 | Grocery List tab | ~45 min |
| 6 | Claude API integration (swap in for rule-based) | ~1.5 hours |
| 7 | Why This? tab, Profile tab, polish | ~1 hour |

---

## Supabase Setup

1. Create a Supabase project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com).

2. Create `.env.local` in the project root (do **not** commit this file):
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your-anon-key
   ```

3. Run the following SQL in the Supabase SQL editor:

```sql
create table if not exists profiles (
  id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id text not null unique,
  profile jsonb not null,
  created_at timestamptz default now(),
  updated_at timestamptz default now()
);

create table if not exists recipes (
  id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id text not null,
  recipe jsonb not null,
  rating int,
  feedback jsonb,
  created_at timestamptz default now(),
  updated_at timestamptz default now()
);
```

**Notes:**
- `.env.local` is gitignored — never commit it.
- This MVP uses a hard-coded `demo-user` ID and has no authentication.
- Before going to production, add Supabase Auth and enable Row Level Security (RLS) so each user only sees their own data.
- If `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` or `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` are missing, the app falls back to localStorage-only mode automatically.

---

## What Is Simulated in the MVP

| Feature | MVP Approach | Future |
|---|---|---|
| Recipe parsing | Regex line splitting | NLP / Claude parsing |
| Nutrition estimates | USDA FoodData Central (static JSON fallback) | Real-time USDA with better matching |
| Grocery prices | `grocery-prices.json` flat file | Real grocery API |
| Taste Score | Formula based on substitution count | User rating feedback loop |
| Personalization from ratings | Not yet implemented | Feed ratings back to transformer |
| Why This? explanations | Dynamic per-recipe explanations | Claude-generated deep analysis |

---

## USDA FoodData Central Setup

Nutrition estimates use the [USDA FoodData Central API](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/) when a key is available, and fall back to the built-in `nutrition-rules.json` table automatically.

1. Get a free API key at [fdc.nal.usda.gov/api-guide.html](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/api-guide.html).

2. Add to `.env.local` (do **not** commit this file):
   ```
   USDA_API_KEY=your_key_here
   ```

3. The app uses USDA data when available and silently falls back to the static JSON if the key is missing, USDA is unreachable, or fewer than 2 ingredients can be matched.

4. Looked-up ingredient nutrition is cached in `localStorage` (`bitebetter_usda_cache`) to avoid redundant API calls.

**Important:** `USDA_API_KEY` is read only in server-side API routes. Never use `NEXT_PUBLIC_` for this key.

---

## FatSecret Setup

FatSecret is an optional second-tier nutrition source. It is used only when USDA cannot match enough ingredients. Static `nutrition-rules.json` remains the final fallback.

1. Create a free developer account at [platform.fatsecret.com](https://platform.fatsecret.com/api/).

2. Add to `.env.local`:
   ```
   FATSECRET_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
   FATSECRET_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
   ```

3. The app uses OAuth 2.0 client credentials flow automatically — no setup beyond adding the credentials.

4. FatSecret lookups are cached in `localStorage` (`bitebetter_fatsecret_cache`) to avoid redundant API calls.

**Nutrition source priority:** USDA → FatSecret → static `nutrition-rules.json`

**Important:** `FATSECRET_CLIENT_ID` and `FATSECRET_CLIENT_SECRET` are read only in server-side API routes. Never use `NEXT_PUBLIC_` for these values.
